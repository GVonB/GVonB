- Hi, I’m Gunnar
- I’m interested in computer science, software development, video editing, foreign language, and UX design. 
- I enjoy playing video games in my free time.
- Flyte#4302 on Discord is the fastest way to get a hold of me.
- Currently, I have my college repositories private. However, I will be adding more as I create personal projects.
