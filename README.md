<h1>Hello👋</h1>
📷 I'm Gunnar, a <b>software developer</b> with a passion for <b>video editing</b>, <b>motion graphics</b>, and <b>3d design</b> pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science.
<br><br>
📖 I love learning and exploring the evolving landscape of technology. I actively seek to expand my skill set to become a more well-rounded contributor to <b>open-source software</b>.
<br><br>
🎞️ Through my video editing hobby, I've created projects with hundreds of thousands of views. I'm currently focusing on learning to take advantage of <b>Blender</b> to create complex, dynamic 3d environments to enhance my storytelling capabilities.
<br><br>
✈️ I enjoy traveling and experiencing new cultures (especially food). I'm always pursuing knowledge of foreign languages to enhance this cultural immersion.
